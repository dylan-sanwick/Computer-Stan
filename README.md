This computer is iconic yet doesn't get enough recognition. I think that it deserves the pride because for its time it was a magnificent computer yet compared to today's standards it isn't. I think that people don't understand what this computer did for the U.S. and making the mark in **history**. It provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, and control of the spacecraft.

**Here are the specs of this computer:**

| Frequency   |   `2.048 MHz`   |   4800 MHz   | 
[^2]: (magnetic-core memory)
[^1]: (IC) chips (RTL based)

While this computer undoubtedly did amazing things, it still barely even comes close to the power of today's computers, for instance, the computer i own, has

I bought it prebuilt however im even planning on customizing my own, here is what it looks like
